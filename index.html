        <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>, in its broadest sense, is         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence" target="_blank">intelligence</a> exhibited by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine" target="_blank">machines</a>, particularly
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_systems" target="_blank">computer systems</a>, as opposed to the natural intelligence of living beings. It is a

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank">computer science</a> that develops and studies methods and software which enable machines to 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_perception" target="_blank">perceive their environment</a> and uses
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">learning</a> and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
        Such machines may be called AIs.

    <p><i>Goals</i></p>
    <p>
        The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. 
        These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. 
        The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.

        <h2>Reasoning and problem solving</h2>
    </article>
    <p>
        Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning" target="_blank">deductions.</a> By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty" target="_blank">uncertain</a> or incomplete information, employing concepts from
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability" target="_blank">probability</a> and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" target="_blank">economics</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": 
        they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early 
        <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.

        A machine with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" target="_blank">artificial general intelligence</a> 
        should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.

    <p><i>Techniques</i></p>
    <p>AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.</p>

        <h2>Learning</h2>
    </article>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">Machine learning</a> is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of 
        <abbr title="Artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several kinds of machine learning. 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning" target="_blank">Unsupervised learning</a> analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" target="_blank">Supervised learning</a> requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties:
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification" target="_blank">classification</a> (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) 
        and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).
    </p>
    <p>
        In 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank">reinforcement learning</a> the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning" target="_blank">Transfer learning</a> is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" target="_blank">Deep learning</a> is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_networks" target="_blank">artificial neural networks</a> for all of these types of learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory" target="_blank">Computational learning theory</a> can assess learners by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity" target="_blank">computational complexity</a>, by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_complexity" target="_blank">sample complexity</a> (how much data is required), or by other notions of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_theory">optimization.</a>
